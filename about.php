						<h2>Our History and Mission</h2>
						<p><? /*<img src="media/images/p/7.jpg" width="270" alt="" class=" frame alignleft" />*/ ?>
							Originally founded in 1986, K&B Engineering set out to become one of the most comprehensive and well versed companies in the industry.  Offering a full range of products and services to suit the construction of major facilities, the company found that they could provide key expertise in the field and could become the backbone of projects and a true ally to developers.  This became our mission.
							<br /><br />
							A decade later, the company expanded from its Los Angeles Headquarters down to Miami where the potential to provide services to Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean, would allow the company to grow exponentially.  We saw that development in these countries would truly benefit from a partner that would take the initiative to suggest various processes and provide key strategies that would assist in creating reinforced structures, from the foundation, to the tiniest screw that holds a picture frame in place.
							<br /><br />
							Presently the company has opened more offices in Latin America to easier facilitate the process of these developments and truly become the backing for our clients.
